# Fivem Blips Scraper

This is a tool created to scrape blips / markers from the fivem documentation.<br>
You can use it both to get the image files or also to generate the blips config for _zerio-dispatch_

## Installation

Simply download the github repo and unpack it into a folder.<br>
Then open a console window in that folder and run `npm install`.

## Usage

Open the console window in the folder you unpacked all files into and run `npm run build`.<br>
This will open a prompt where you can choose what you want to do.
<br><br>
After running the build process all images will be exported to the `./images` folder.<br>
If you chose to also create a config for zerio-dispatch it will be named "`SharedBlips.lua`"
